# 100daycodingchallenge
Here I'm going to start my 100 Day Coding Challenge, an initiative to help me improve my coding skills by practicing consistently for 100 days.  The goal of this challenge is to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days, and to document my progress in this repository by committing my code changes regularly.
